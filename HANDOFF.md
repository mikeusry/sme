1. Main landing page highlighting the NEW eco-friendly grazing service
2. Service-specific pages for retention ponds, solar farms, and HOA communities

Key messaging:
- 30-50% cost savings vs. traditional mowing
- Partnership with Bo Carter (grazing specialist)

Make it conversion-optimized with clear CTAs and trust-building elements.
