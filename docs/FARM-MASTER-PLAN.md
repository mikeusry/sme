# Soul Miner's Eden — Farm Master Plan & Revenue Strategy

**February 2026 — v1.0**
**Priority Stack:** Beautiful → Easy → Marketing Stage → Break-Even+
**Prepared for Mike — TUFCO Holdings / Southland Organics / Soul Miners Company**

---

## Executive Summary

Soul Miner's Eden started as a land restoration project inspired by the idea that we're called to steward what we've been given — to make it beautiful, productive, and a reflection of something greater than ourselves. That mission hasn't changed. What's changed is that the pieces are now in place to make the farm sustain itself financially while becoming more beautiful, not less.

Here's the core idea: we already sit on 5,000 tons of compost with zero competitors within 60 miles. That pile alone conservatively generates $60,000–$150,000 in revenue. It funds everything else. The livestock, the honor stand, the infrastructure — the compost bankrolls all of it without taking on debt or pulling from Southland operations.

We live 30 minutes from Athens — a town full of educated, high-income people who will pay $12 a dozen for pasture-raised eggs, $15 a gallon for raw milk, and $35 for a whole chicken. They don't blink at premium pricing because they're buying the story, not the commodity. They want to know where their food comes from, they want to visit the farm, and they want to post about it on Instagram. Our job is to make the farm worth posting about. That's it.

The beautiful part is that Priority #1 — making this property gorgeous — is the same thing that drives revenue. A beautiful farm with healthy animals on lush pasture surrounded by managed silvopasture is the marketing. It's the product proof for Southland's biology. It's the reason Athens families drive out on a Saturday to buy eggs and raw milk from an honor stand. And it's the backdrop for every piece of content we film for the Ag & Culture Podcast and Allen Reynolds' YouTube channel.

Bo Carter brings animals, time, and expertise. We bring land, equipment, and staff. Together we're building a diversified small farm — cattle, sheep, goats, poultry, pigs — that operates on rotational grazing and silvopasture principles. Everything is 100% natural, soy/corn-free, and transparent. The honor system farm stand runs 24/7 with near-zero labor. The inspected kitchen enables value-add products like bone broth.

This is not a hobby farm. At base case projections, Year 1 revenue is $211,500 against ~$36,000 in startup costs. But it's also not an operation that sacrifices beauty for production. The priority stack is non-negotiable: Beautiful first. Easy to maintain second. Marketing value third. Financial returns fourth. If it doesn't make the property more beautiful, we don't do it.

The farm pays for itself. The land gets better every year. And the kids grow up watching it happen.

## 1. Property Overview

Soul Miner's Eden is a 65-acre property in Georgia featuring rolling hills, improved clay soils, mixed immature forests, and active water features. The name was inspired by John Mark Comer's *Garden City* during early land restoration work. The property serves as both the operational base for Southland Organics and a living demonstration of biology-based land management.

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Total Acreage | 65 acres (12 acres house exclusion = 53 usable) |
| Pasture | 20 acres currently in pasture |
| Topography | Rolling hills |
| Soil | Georgia clay, improved through management and ample compost |
| Water | 2 small ponds, 1 active creek, 1 dry creek bed |
| Timber | Mixed species, immature forests |
| Infrastructure | GA Dept of Ag inspected kitchen, perimeter fencing (partial) |
| Equipment | Volvo 220EL Excavator, JD 333G Skid Steer, Cat 304.5 Mini Ex, Cat 200D Micro Ex, Komatsu Wheel Loader, Case Vestrum 130 Tractor, JD 6420 Tractor, Dump Truck |

---

## 2. Property Zone Plan

The 53 usable acres should be organized into functional zones that support the priority stack. Each zone serves multiple purposes across beautification, production, marketing, and revenue.

| Zone | Acres (Est.) | Primary Use | Revenue Angle |
|------|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| A — Silvopasture | 15–18 | Rotational grazing under managed tree canopy | Livestock, carbon, timber long-term |
| B — Open Pasture | 5–8 | Cattle/sheep rotation, hay production | Meat, dairy, wool/hides |
| C — Poultry Operations | 2–3 | Layer flock + meat bird batches, mobile coops | Eggs, chicken, bone broth |
| D — Compost & Landscape Supply | 3–5 | Screening, storage, colored mulch staging. **Separate contractor lane (dump trucks, loaders) from family/visitor flow.** One entrance, two paths. | Compost, mulch, soil blends |
| E — Farm Store & Honor Stand | 0.5 | Refrigerator/freezer self-serve, signage | All DTC farm products |
| F — Demo Plots & Filming | 1–2 | Southland product trials, podcast set | Marketing content, product proof |
| G — Woodland / Riparian | 10–15 | Creek corridors, wildlife, future timber | Beautification, agritourism trails |
| H — Pig Paddocks | 2–3 | Rotational pig finishing in woodland edge | Pork, lard |

Zone acreages are estimates pending a property walkthrough with Bo to designate boundaries and fence plan. Zones G and A will overlap significantly as silvopasture establishes.

## 3. Livestock Operations

### 3.1 Cattle

The 4 Holstein-Hereford cross heifers are the foundation herd. Adding a Jersey cow already in milk enables raw milk production for direct-to-consumer sales under the Georgia Raw Dairy Act (HB-1175). Raw milk requires a GA Dept of Agriculture permit with facility inspection, regular testing, sampling, and labeling ("Grade A Raw"). Given the existing GA Dept of Ag inspected kitchen, permitting should be straightforward.

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Current Herd | 4 Holstein-Hereford cross heifers |
| Planned Addition | 1 Jersey cow, already in milk (not a heifer) |
| Total Cattle | 5–6 head on 20+ acres rotational — comfortable stocking rate |
| Dairy Revenue | 1 fresh Jersey = 4–6 gal/day; at $10–12/gal = $40–72/day at honor stand |
| Beef Revenue | Long-term from heifer calves/steers |
| Grazing Plan | Rotational across Zones A & B |
| Feed Strategy | 100% grass-fed, soy/corn-free, supplemented with Southland biology |
| Regulatory | GA Raw Dairy permit required; labeling/testing/inspection compliance |

**Why one Jersey, not two:** One fresh Jersey oversupplies a startup honor stand. Scale to two once demand proves out. Start with a cow already in milk to generate revenue immediately.

### 3.2 Sheep (Bo Carter Partnership)

Bo Carter provides animals, time, and livestock expertise. Soul Miner's Eden provides land, equipment, staff assistance, and resources. This partnership will be formalized via a simple one-page handshake agreement between Mike and Bo.

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Target Flock | 15–20 ewes + ram |
| Lamb Production | 20–30 lambs/year |
| Breed Recommendation | Dorper crosses — meat + hide income, no shearing labor; OR Katahdin/St. Croix hair sheep for zero maintenance |
| Revenue — Lamb | High-end lamb $12–18/lb hanging weight |
| Revenue — Hides | Sheepskin hides $75–150 each |
| Co-Grazing | Sheep and cattle rotate together — different forage preferences, parasite cycle interruption |
| Bo Covers | His own animals, vet, insurance |
| Eden Covers | Land, fencing, water infrastructure, equipment, staff |

### 3.3 Goats (Bo Carter Partnership)

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Target Herd | 10–15 head |
| Primary Purpose | Understory clearing for silvopasture conversion — browsers, not grazers |
| Secondary Revenue | Billable land-clearing services to neighbors; meat |
| Zone | Rotational through woodland areas targeted for silvopasture thinning |

### 3.4 Poultry

Egg layers and meat birds are the fastest path to honor-stand revenue. Georgia's on-farm poultry processing exemption allows up to 1,000 birds annually without USDA inspection when sold direct-to-consumer. This is a natural extension of Southland's poultry expertise and product line.

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Layers | Start 50, scale to 75 based on demand; soy/corn-free feed; target $8–12/dozen premium |
| Meat Birds | 25 per batch, 4–6 batches/year (100–150 birds/year); $6–8/lb whole bird ($25–35 each) |
| Bone Broth | Value-add from carcasses; $15–20/quart via inspected kitchen |
| Housing | Mobile coops for rotational grazing integration |
| Products Demonstrated | Catalyst poultry vitamins, ZeroPoint sanitation in coops |
| Content Angle | Allen Reynolds films real-world product use on Eden flock |

**Regulatory note:** Georgia's small poultry exemption caps at 1,000 birds/year for on-farm direct-to-consumer sales without USDA inspection. Year 1 plan (100–150 meat birds + 50–75 layers) is well under. If scaling above 1,000 birds, a GDA small poultry processor license is required (covers up to 20,000 birds/year).

### 3.5 Pigs

Pigs serve dual purpose: woodland edge clearing and premium pork production. All pork goes through a USDA-inspected processor. **Book processor slots immediately — Georgia has 6–12 month waitlists.**

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Scale | 4–6 feeder pigs per batch, 2 batches/year (8–12 pigs/year) |
| Breed | Heritage (Berkshire, Red Wattle) — premium pricing, photograph well |
| Revenue | Half-hog sales direct $5–7/lb hanging weight |
| Processing | USDA-inspected facility — book NOW |
| Grazing | Rotational woodland edge paddocks (Zone H, 2–3 acres) |
| Feed | Soy/corn-free; supplement with whey (from dairy) and compost scraps |

### 3.6 Total Livestock Summary

| Species | Head Count | Primary Revenue | Zone |
|---------|-----------|----------------|------|
| Cattle (Holstein-Hereford crosses) | 4 heifers | Beef (long-term) | A, B |
| Cattle (Jersey, in milk) | 1 cow | Raw milk $40–72/day | A, B |
| Sheep (ewes + ram) | 15–20 + 1 | Lamb, hides | A, B |
| Goats | 10–15 | Land clearing, meat | Woodland/silvopasture |
| Pigs (per batch) | 4–6 (x2/year) | Pork, lard | H |
| Layers | 50–75 | Eggs | C |
| Meat birds (per batch) | 25 (x4–6/year) | Whole chicken, broth | C |

## 4. Compost & Landscape Supply

The 5,000-ton compost pile from land-clearing primary grind, windrowed 12+ months and turned, is the most immediate revenue asset on the property. **Zero compost competitors within 60 miles.** We set the price.

### 4.1 Screening

Trommel screener secured for $1,200 transport cost. We provide labor and machinery (wheel loader, excavator). **Treat the first 100–200 tons as an R&D run** — validate quality, measure screened yield ratio, and sell at a slight discount to local contractors to build relationships. Lock in final pricing once consistency is proven. Don't set prices before you see what comes out of the screen.

### 4.2 Equipment & Turner Problem

We own a PTO compost turner that cannot currently be used. The Case Vestrum 130 was purchased to pull it, but the sales rep misrepresented the tractor — **it has no creeper gear.** Aftermarket retrofit was attempted and failed. Trade-in value is $40K underwater. The JD 6420 lacks both creeper gear and HP for the turner.

**Current workaround:** Excavator turns windrows manually. Slower, less consistent, but functional.

**Decision gate:** If compost sales hit $50–60K in Year 1, purchase a used tractor with creeper gear and sufficient HP ($25K–$45K) funded entirely by compost revenue. The turner then unlocks higher throughput and consistency for Year 2 scaling.

**Equipment by function:**

| Function | Equipment |
|----------|-----------|
| Earthmoving / Compost Ops | Volvo 220EL Excavator, Komatsu Wheel Loader, Cat 304.5 Mini Ex, Cat 200D Micro Ex, JD 333G Skid Steer, Dump Truck, Trommel (rented) |
| Pasture / Silvopasture | Case Vestrum 130 + Power Harrow + Compagna Seeder |
| General / Utility | JD 6420 Tractor |
| Sidelined (pending tractor) | PTO Compost Turner |

### 4.3 Product Mix & Pricing

| Product | Wholesale/Ton | Retail/Ton | Notes |
|---------|--------------|-----------|-------|
| Screened Compost | $35–45 | $45–60+ | No competition = price leader. Don't underprice. |
| Eden Blend (Premium) | $50–65 | $65–85 | Compost + Genesis biology; branded Southland product |
| Natural Mulch (screened overs) | $18–25 | $30–40 | Oversized material from screening |
| Colored Mulch | $25–35 | $40–55 | Buy wholesale pre-colored, mark up |
| Bulk Soil Blends | $30–45 | $50–65 | Compost + topsoil + amendments |
| Supersack Delivery | Premium | Premium | Unique delivery capability in the region |

### 4.4 Revenue Projection (Compost Pile)

Assumes 60% of 5,000 tons screens as saleable compost (3,000 tons). Remaining 40% sells as natural mulch or is recomposted.

| Scenario | Volume Sold | Blended Avg $/Ton | Gross Revenue |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|---------------|
| Conservative | 1,500 tons Year 1 | $40 | $60,000 |
| Base | 2,500 tons Year 1 | $45 | $112,500 |
| Aggressive | 3,000+ tons Year 1 | $50 | $150,000+ |

### 4.5 Immediate Actions

- Screen test batch (100 tons) to validate quality and yield ratio — screener arriving for $1,200 transport
- Set up retail area (Zone D) — signage, scale, loader access for self-load customers
- Eden Blend pilot — mix 10 tons compost with Genesis, test premium pricing
- Wholesale outreach — landscape contractors, nurseries, garden centers within 60 miles (you're the only option)
- Supersack logistics — price delivery radius, minimum orders

## 5. Revenue Streams Beyond Livestock & Compost

### 5.1 Farm-to-Table Dinners

Upscale bistro setting already exists on property. Athens demographic will pay $150–250/head for a 20–30 seat dinner sourced from the farm. Partner with a local chef (not hire) to keep it easy. Monthly or seasonal cadence. Special events permit required for larger gatherings; small dinners operate without.

### 5.2 Subscriptions & Memberships

| Offering | Price Point | Model |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| CSA / Farm Box | $50–75/week | Weekly/biweekly box: eggs, milk, meat, broth, seasonal items. Recurring revenue, predictable demand. |
| Herdshare Membership | $40–60/month | Raw milk allocation. Launch waitlist before Jersey arrives to build demand. |
| Farm Tour | $50–75/family | Weekend only, 1 hour. Bo walks livestock, Mike shows biology. Sell Southland products after. |
| Workshop Series | $75–150/person | Composting, backyard poultry, soil biology. Product sales at the back of the room. |

### 5.3 Seasonal Events

## 6. Farm Store & Honor System

The honor-stand model minimizes labor (Priority #2) while maximizing brand authenticity (Priority #3). A roadside or on-property self-serve station with refrigerator, freezer, and dry goods creates a 24/7 revenue point with near-zero staffing cost.

### 6.1 Product Offering

| Product | Unit Price | Source | Margin Est. |
|---------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Pasture-Raised Eggs (soy/corn-free) | $8–12/dozen | On-farm layers (50–75 hens) | 60–70% |
| Raw Milk (Grade A Raw) | $10–12/gallon | Jersey cow, GA permit | 50–60% |
| Whole Chicken (pasture-raised) | $25–35 each | On-farm processing (<1,000/yr) | 40–50% |
| Bone Broth | $15–20/quart | Inspected kitchen | 65–75% |
| Lamb (cuts/whole) | $12–18/lb hanging | USDA processor | 35–45% |
| Sheepskin Hides | $75–150 each | Bo Carter partnership | 50–60% |
| Pork (half/whole hog) | $5–7/lb hanging | USDA processor | 35–45% |
| Compost/Soil (bagged) | $8–12/bag | On-site screening | 70–80% |
| Eden Blend (premium) | $12–18/bag | Compost + Genesis | 65–75% |

### 6.2 Infrastructure Requirements

- Commercial refrigerator and chest freezer (outdoor-rated or sheltered)
- Payment system: cash lockbox + QR code for Venmo/CashApp/Square

## 7. Silvopasture Implementation

Silvopasture integrates trees, forage, and livestock on the same land — increasing per-acre productivity, improving animal welfare, building soil, and creating the aesthetic beauty that is Priority #1. The existing immature mixed forest and 20 acres of pasture provide a strong starting position.

### 7.1 Approach

Two parallel tracks based on existing land condition:

**Track 1 — Forest Thinning (Woodland → Silvopasture):** Selectively thin immature forest to 40–60 stems/acre, allowing sunlight to establish understory forage. Keep highest-value timber species (oak, hickory, walnut). Use pigs and goats for initial understory clearing before overseeding with shade-tolerant forages.

**Track 2 — Tree Establishment (Pasture → Silvopasture):** Plant tree rows in existing pasture at 30–40 ft spacing. Recommended species: black walnut (timber + nut income at year 15+), persimmon (wildlife + fruit), chestnut (feed supplement), and fast-growing natives for canopy. Protect young trees with electric fence or tree tubes. **Use the Case Vestrum 130 + power harrow + Compagna seeder for forage establishment between tree rows** — this is the Vestrum's highest-value use since it can't pull the turner.

### 7.2 Southland Product Demonstration

Every zone becomes a living trial plot for Southland products. Proof comes from what's **visible and filmable** — not lab reports.

| Product | Application on Eden | Proof Method |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| Genesis | Applied to pasture and tree plantings to accelerate soil biology | Brix refractometer readings on forage (before/after), visual forage density, drone footage |
| Catalyst | Poultry and livestock vitamin supplementation | Flock health, egg production rates, weight gain, animal condition on camera |
| ZeroPoint HOCL | Coop sanitation, dairy equipment, kitchen/processing | Biosecurity protocol documentation, visual cleanliness |
| Eden Blend (new) | Premium compost + Genesis biology for retail | Side-by-side garden trials for marketing content |
| Carbon Fresh | Biochar application in silvopasture soil building | Moisture retention visuals, forage growth comparisons |

**Brix refractometer** — cheap, filmable, credible to the regen community. Baseline readings on forage before Genesis application, then periodic readings through the season. This is the one data point worth capturing.

### 7.3 Timeline

| Phase | Timeframe | Actions |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Phase 1: Foundation | Months 1–3 | Brix baseline readings; fence planning; Bo Carter handshake agreement; forest inventory; processor bookings; screener arrives |
| Phase 2: Infrastructure | Months 3–6 | Cross-fencing for rotational grazing; water system to pastures; honor stand build-out; Jersey cow acquisition; layer flock start |
| Phase 3: Silvopasture Start | Months 6–12 | Track 1 thinning begins; Track 2 tree planting (fall/winter); pig paddock establishment; first meat bird batch |
| Phase 4: Revenue Ramp | Months 12–18 | Full honor stand product line; compost sales at scale; first lamb/pork harvest; agritourism soft launch |
| Phase 5: Maturation | Year 2–3 | Silvopasture forage established; dairy production steady; branded Eden Blend at volume; agritourism events |

| Seasonal Events (pumpkins, etc.) | $3,000 | $8,000 | $15,000 |
| **Total Year 1 Revenue** | **$95,000** | **$211,500** | **$323,000** |

**2028 Addition: Christmas Tree Lot & Market** — not modeled in Year 1. Projected $15,000–$40,000 in first season (imported Fraser Firs from NC + nativity + market vendors + farm products).

### 9.2 Key Cost Assumptions

| Cost Category | Estimated Year 1 |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Screener transport | $1,200 |
| Fencing (cross-fencing, rotational) | $8,000–$15,000 |
| Jersey Cow (in milk) | $1,500–$3,000 |
| Poultry (birds, coops, feed) | $5,000–$8,000 |
| Feeder Pigs | $1,500–$2,500 |
| USDA Processing (pork/lamb) | $3,000–$5,000 |
| Honor Stand Build-Out | $2,000–$4,000 |
| Tree Stock (silvopasture) | $1,000–$3,000 |
| Raw Milk Permitting | $500–$1,500 |
| Raw Milk Testing (4 samples/6 months, temp, somatic cell) | $1,500–$2,500/year ongoing |
| **Total Estimated Investment** | **$25,500–$46,500** |

At base case ($211,500 revenue) against midpoint costs (~$36,000), Year 1 gross margin is approximately $175,500 before labor allocation. The compost pile alone funds the entire livestock and infrastructure build-out.
