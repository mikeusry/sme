  - `sod-soil.jpg`

---

## Important Technical Notes & Gotchas

### 1. Cloudinary Image Paths
**CRITICAL:** All Cloudinary public IDs must include:
- Full path prefix: `Soul Miner's/products/{category}/`
- Double extension: `.jpg.jpg` (due to migration script adding .jpg to existing .jpg files)

Example: `Soul Miner's/products/compost/TOPO_compost.jpg.jpg`

### 2. URL Encoding
The `buildCloudinaryUrl()` function in `/frontend/src/lib/cloudinary.ts` automatically encodes spaces and special characters:
```typescript
const encodedPublicId = fullPublicId.split('/').map(segment => encodeURIComponent(segment)).join('/');
```
Result: `Soul%20Miner%27s/products/...`

### 3. Product Data Structure
Products are defined in `/scripts/parse-products.js` and generated to `/data/products.json`
- To add products: Edit parse-products.js → Run `npm run parse:products`
- TypeScript types defined in `/frontend/src/lib/products.ts`
- Product slugs used for routing must be URL-safe

### 4. Tailwind CSS v4
- Using `@theme` directive instead of `@apply`
- Custom properties defined in `/frontend/src/styles/global.css`
- Direct CSS classes used for components (no @apply)

### 5. Image Migration Source
Images were migrated from **LOCAL FOLDER** (`/Users/mikeusry/Desktop/Southland In Progress/Soul Miner's Website/Soils & Mulch/`), NOT from the live soulminerseden.com website. If you need images from the live site, you'll need to download them separately.

### 6. Git Repository
- Repository initialized in this session
- Remote: https://github.com/mikeusry/sme
- Ready to push with `git push -u origin main`
