# Soul Miner's Eden Voice & Messaging Guide

> Writing that feels like a warm invitation to the farm

---

## Brand Voice Overview

Soul Miner's Eden speaks with a voice that is:

- **Warm** but not saccharine
- **Hopeful** but not naive
- **Faith-rooted** but not preachy
- **Expert** but not condescending
- **Local** but not provincial
- **Invitational** always

We're not a landscape supply company that happens to have a nice story. We're a family with a calling who happens to sell compost.
